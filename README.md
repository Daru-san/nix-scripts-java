# nix-utils-java

My NixOS utilities rewritten in Java

## What's this?

A repo containing my NixOS utilities which
I wrote as bash scripts, rewritten in Java
and packaged in a flake

## Progress

I am still getting to know java so this
is still in a very experimental phase
but the more I learn, the more I features will add

## Status

- [ ] Flake working
- [ ] Home manager program working
- [ ] Nixos rebuild program working
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Built successfully
